## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimers ‚ö†Ô∏è

- Check the sha1sum/md5sum of the files [__here__](sums.md)

<br>

- Activation script for `Office 2016` works fine, but sometimes for `Office 2019` Windows Defender deletes the file ([check this article](https://www.quora.com/I-faced-this-thread-HackTool-Win32-AutoKMS-in-windows-defender-win-10-pro-What-should-I-do)). The `HackTool: Win32/AutoKMS` is not virus ([Google search results](https://www.google.com/search?q=is+HackTool%3A+Win32%2FAutoKMS+virus)) , so don't worry - turn off windows defender OR (recommended) select `allow threats on device` option ([How to allow threat in windows?](https://www.google.com/search?q=allow+threats+in+windows)) to use 'office_2019.cmd' to activate Office 2019 License.
